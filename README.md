I am a graduate of B.Sc. Forestry from the Institute of Forestry, Tribhuvan University, Nepal. My research interests lie at the intersection, of Forestry, GIS, Ecology, Remote sensing, and machine learning. I am always looking for collaboration opportunities for work or research in these fields.

### Featured Projects
- [Potato Disease classifier](https://pratyush-dh.github.io/diseasepotato.html): Trained a potato disease classifier using TensorFlow JS and deployed it as web 
application.
- [Multiclass Land Use Land Cover Classification Using TensorFlow](https://github.com/pratyush-dh/satellite-image-classification-using-python): Performed LCLU classification of Kathmandu 
region from a Landsat 8 image using a FCNN. Prepared training data using ArcMap and automated hyper-parameter tuning using Keras Tuner.
- [Swimming Pool Detection](https://github.com/pratyush-dh/swimming-pool-detection): Prepared training datasets using ArcMap and RoboFlow. Modified YOLOv5 model to 
detect swimming pools. 
- [Real-time Multi-class object detection](https://pratyush-dh.github.io/classifier.html): Applied transfer learning to a pre-trained TensorFlow model for identify common household 
objects and deployed it as a web application.
- [DEM to Stream Network tool](https://github.com/pratyush-dh/tools): Combined several hydrology tools in ArcGIS model builder to create a tool that 
takes DEM, threshold value and output name as inputs and give a stream network as its output.
